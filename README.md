# Cpp-Password-Manager
*Important* - This program currently runs on memory and is not applicable for real world use. The final product should not be used for real world used either as this project is mainly for learning purposes only. 

# What is it? 
The idea was to make a password manager that stores an username + password in an encrypted format in a database such as SQLite. The program uses a cryptography tool called Libsodium which is what allows the username + password in an encrypted form or also called ciphertext. 

- The program is currently at the stage where I am implementing a Master Password feature. 

# What technologies does it use? 
- QT Gui framework
- C++
- Libsodium

# What does the program look like?
